## Compilation / Linking

1. Compilation process:
    
    ![2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled.png](2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled.png)
    
    - Pre-processing: via the GNU C Preprocessor (cpp.exe), which **includes the headers (#include) and expands the macros** (#define).
        
        ```bash
        cpp  hello.c > hello.i
        ```
        
        - The resultant intermediate file "hello.i" contains the expanded source code.
        - Use Important use-case for #define and #ifndef :
            - Preventing repeated inclusion of header files, because Header files may include other header files (infinite recursion possible)!
    - Compilation: The compiler compiles the pre-processed source code into **assembly code for a specific processor. notice that assembly code is machine dependent**
        - Generally not directly executable: unresolved references to functions or variables from other object files
        - Compiler will check code for syntactic and semantic correctness
        
        ```c
        //The -S option specifies to produce assembly code, instead of object code. The resultant assembly file is "hello.s".
        gcc -S hello.i
        ```
        
    - Assembly: The assembler (as.exe) converts the assembly code **into machine code in the object file "hello.o.  notice code cpu dependent.**
        
        ```c
        as -o hello.o hello.s
        ```
        
    - Linker: Finally, the linker (ld.exe) **links the object code with the librar**y code to **produce an executable file "hello.exe".**
        - Two linking modes:
            - dynamic: Libraries are loaded when starting the program, reference resolution at start- or even at runtime
            - static: Libraries are linked at link/build time, yielding a completely linked “static” binary containing all external dependencies
        
        ```c
        ld -o hello.exe hello.o ...libraries..
        ```
        
2. Q: **Why hello world can’t run on bare metal?**
    - No dynamic linker available on bare metal (solution: link all necessary libraries statically)
    - No system calls - > Can’t use Standard CPP library in OS development
    - All functions and variable use virtual memory address, which is defined by linker  (- >need a custom linker config)
    - High-level language code needs environment setup (stack, CPU-register usage, address mapping) , need to specify which register contain return address etc.
        - Need own startup code (written in assembler) to setup the environment .
3. Is OS development in a high level programming language (C, CPP, etc.)?
    
    Yes, but can’t use standard libs.
    
4. **Q: Difference between static and shared linking**
    - A **static library:  w**hen your program is linked against a static library, **the machine code of external functions used in your program is copied into the executable.**
        - Pros:
            - Load time faster
        - Cons:
            - compile time is longer
            - output binary is bigger
    - A s**hared library:**  when your program is linked against a shared librar**y, only a small table is created in the executable. Before the executable starts running, the operating system loads the machine code needed for the external functions** .
        
        Pros:
        
        - **makes executable files smaller and saves disk space,** because one copy of a library can be shared between multiple programs. Furthermore,
        - **most operating systems allows one copy of a shared library in memory to be used by all running programs, thus, saving memory**.
        - Easy for bug fix in library, because we only need to update the lib, no need to recompile the source file
        
        Cons:
        
        - start time is slower(linked content should be copied if the OS doesn’t loaded it yet)
        - linker errors are thrown in runtime

## Booting

Booting is a process of starting a computer. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage, a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage:

- Start the system (turn on the machine)
- CPU jump to a fixed address, where has the BIOS code, and execute the BIOS code
- The BIOS performs basic system initialization (such as activating the video card and checking the amount of memory installed) and validation
- BIOS loads the operating system from some appropriate location such as  hard disk, CD-ROM, and passes control of the machine to the operating system

1. **The Boot Loader**
    
    Hard disks for PCs are divided into 512 byte regions called *sectors.* A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity: each read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size and aligned on a sector boundary. 
    
    If the disk is bootable, the first sector is called the ***boot sector***, since this is where the boot loader code resides. When the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk, it loads the 512-byte boot sector (which store the boot loader code) into a fixed physical memory address, and then uses a jmp to jump to this location.  Then, CPU will execute the boot loader. 
    
    The boot loader must perform following things:
    
    - Define hardware/software state
        - Set up registers to switches the processor from real mode to *32-bit protected mode*
            - Real Mode
                
                In real mode, memory is limited to only one megabyte (2^20 bytes). Valid
                address range from (in hex) 00000 to FFFFF. These addresses require a
                20-bit number. Obviously, a 20-bit number will not fit into any of the
                8086’s 16-bit registers. Intel solved this problem, by using two 16-bit values
                determine an address. The first 16-bit value is called the selector. Selector
                values must be stored in segment registers. The second 16-bit value is called
                the offset. The physical address referenced by a 32-bit `selector:offset` pair is
                computed by the formula `16 ∗ selector + offset`
                
                Con:
                
                - A single selector value can only reference 64K of memory (the upper
                limit of the 16-bit offset). What if a program has more than 64K of
                code? A single value in CS can not be used for the entire execution
                of the program. The program must be split up into sections (called
                segments) less than 64K in size. When execution moves from one segment to another, the value of CS must be changed. Similar problems
                occur with large amounts of data and the DS register. This can be
                very awkward!
                - Each byte in memory does not have a unique segmented address. The
                physical address 04808 can be referenced by 047C:0048, 047D:0038,
                047E:0028 or 047B:0058. This can complicate the comparison of segmented addresses.
            - Protect mode
                
                Protected mode uses a technique called virtual memory
                
                1. 16-bit Protected Mode
                    - segments are moved between memory and disk as needed
                        
                        When a segment is returned to memory from disk, it is very likely that it will be put into a different area of memory that it was in before being moved to disk. All of this is done transparently by the operating system. The program does not have to be written differently for virtual memory to work.
                        
                    - each segment is assigned an entry in a descriptor table
                        
                        This entry has all the information that the system needs to know
                        about the segment. This information includes: is it currently in memory;
                        if in memory, where is it; access permissions (e.g., read-only). The index
                        of the entry of the segment is the selector value that is stored in segment
                        registers
                        
                    - Con: segment sizes are still limited to at most 64K, because the offset are still 16bit long
                2. 32-bit Protected Mode
                    
                    Two major differences between 386 32-bit and 286 16-bit protected modes:
                    
                    - Offsets are expanded to be 32-bits. This allows an offset to range up
                    to 4 billion. Thus, segments can have sizes up to 4 gigabytes.
                    - Segments can be divided into smaller 4K-sized units called pages. The
                    virtual memory system works with pages now instead of segments.
                    This means that only parts of segment may be in memory at any one
                    time.
        - Set up the protected-mode data segment registers, etc.
    - Load the kernel/system
    - Jump into loaded system

### Debugging und Testing

1. Type of debugging
    - Emulators: emulate real hardware in software
        - Simplifies debugging
        - Shorter development cyclles
        - **Emulation is a special case of virtualization, which provides a virtual resource Y based on based on a resource X**
    - Debugger helps locating software bugs by tracing/controlling the debuggee:
        - **Single-step mode**
        - **Breakpoints**: trigger when reaching a particular machine instruction
        - **Watchpoints**: trigger when a particular data element is accessed
        
        ->
        
        Bug-hunting might take longer
        
        Synchronization / race-condition bugs are impractical to debug with a debugger
        

- Core dump” analysis : A **[core dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump)** is a file containing a process's address space (memory) and cpu state when the process terminates unexpectedly.  Later, we can use debuger to analysis it.
- Printf debugging
    - printf() often changes the debuggee’s behavior  -> Problem vanishes / changes symptoms
1. Technical Background (How dose the debugging work behind the scenes/ How hardware supports debugging?)
    - **INT3** instruction triggers a “breakpoint interrupt” (in fact a trap)
        - User “sets breakpoint”, debugger (at runtime) places INT3 in program code
        - Trap handler redirects control flow to debugger
    - **enabled Trap Flag (TF) i**n status register (EFLAGS / RFLAGS), trigger “debug interrupt” after every instruction
        - Can be used for implementing single-stepping in the debugger
        - Trap handler is not executed in single-stepping mode
    - **Debug Registers DR0–DR7** can monitor up to 4 breakpoints or watchpoints
        - No code manipulation necessary: breakpoints in ROM/FLASH
        or read-only memory segments (e.g. shared libraries!)
        - Efficient watchpoints only possible through this mechanism
        - The registers are protected in supervisor mode, how can the user space application use it to do debugging?
            - Use `ptrace` system call. With `ptrace` system call one process(tracer) can trace/manipulate other processes (tracee).
2. Remote debugging
    - Requires communications link (serial, Ethernet, …)
    - Target should have a GDB stub, the minimum stub functionality is
        - read/write single register
        - read/write memory area
        - continue execution
    

### Summary of lecture

- Operating-system development differs significantly from regular application development:
    - No libraries
    - Bare metal is the basis we build upon
- The first steps are often the hardest
    - Compilation/linking, booting, system initialization
- Comfortable bug hunting necessitates infrastructure
    - Device drivers for “printf debugging”
    - Stub and communication link/driver for remote debugging
    - Hardware debugging support like with BDM
    - deal: Professional hardware debuggers (e.g. Lauterbach)

# Exercise (E01 + E02)

### C++ Concepts

1. Control Structures and Variable Types
    - C++ allows “global” functions, while in Java methods must be part of a class
        
        **Q: how to use exterc C**
        
        - In particular, C++ allows calling “normal” C and assembler functions or ves reverse using extern “C”
            
            In general, CPP and C have different linking sematic since CPP have to support function overloading, i.e., they have different name mangling rules. For C linker, the symbol representing a function in the symbol table is exactly the function name. However, For  CPP linker, this is not the case, CPP encodes the parameter types and function name in the symbol.   To this end, you can’t call the cpp function using it’s name from c directly, because the symbol name doesn’t match the function name.  On the other hand, you can’t call c/assembly function from cpp either. This is where 'extern "C"' comes into play:
            
            If you compile a function DEFINITION (like in square2.cc) with a C++ compiler, and this function definition is prefixed with 'extern "C"', you tell the compiler to disable name mangling, i.e. to use the C-style way of generating a symbol name that's identical to the function name.  If you do this to a C++ function, it becomes easily callable from C or assembly, by simply using its "common" name (e.g., "call square").
            
            If you compile a function DECLARATION -- like in cpu.h line 16 -- that is prefixed with 'extern "C"' with a C++ compiler, you tell the compiler two things: a) there exists a function called e.g. int_enabled in a different translation unit (and the linker will find and link it), and b) it uses C-style symbol naming, not C++-style name mangling.  If you do this to a function declaration in a C++ program, the function definition (in a separate .c or .asm file) becomes callable from C++.
            
    - Variable may place on heap, stack, data segment and BSS segment
        - stack contain local variable
        - data segment contain global initialized variable
        - BSS segment contain global uninitialized variables (zerod)
        - Heap contain dynamic allocated variables (malloc)
    - Local variable or variable on heap  do not have default values, must explicitly be initialized
    - Memory management must be done by the programmer
    - No run time checks for array boundaries - > May access other variables...
    
    - **Q: What is the difference between java and CPP**
        1. Java variable are on heap vs CPP variable can on heap, BSS, DATA segment, etc
        2. Java has JVM, which dose the memory management for Programmer vs CPP programmer must handle memory management by their own
        3. Java has runtime array boundary checking provided by JVM vs CPP dose not have runtime array boundary checking
        
2. Value Ranges: 
    - Has signed and unsigned types
    - Value ranges are machine / architecture / compiler specific
    - With `typedef` we can define new types based on existing ones
3. Complex data type
    - enums: Enumeration types
        
        ```cpp
        enum { caps_lock = 4, num_lock = 2, scroll_lock = 1 };
        ```
        
    - Struct
4. Classes (file name and class name do not have to match)
    - A class consists of a declaration in a header file and an implementation file
    - Header contains:
        - Attributes (variables)
        - Constructors/destructors
        - Method declarations
    - Implementation-File:
        - #include the corresponding header file
        - Class name plus scope operator “:: ” tell the compiler, which class a method (or constructor/destructor) belongs to:
5. Pointer
    - Pointer itself contain address the pointer points to
    - Address operator &, get the address of a variable
    - Dereferencing operator * Yields the value that is stored at the address the pointer “points to”
6. References: 
    - Semantically: Alias to a variable name
    - Technically: Initialized, immutable pointers
        - Upon initialization of a reference, the compiler automatically takes the
        address of the initializing object.
        - When using a reference in an expression, automatically the referenced
        object is used.
        
        ![Untitled](2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled%201.png)
        
7. Operator Overloading: 
    - Operators behave depending on the data type they operate on
    - Only possible for operators defined in the language
8. Systems Programming in C++
    - Only has CPP basic language features
    - No runtime environment available  - > No dynamic object instantiation (No “new”, no “delete”)
    - No Exceptions, assertions, runtime type information
9. CPP allow Single/Multiple  Inheritance
    
    ```c
    #include "interrupt.h"
    class keyboard_interrupt : public interrupt, public keys {
    public:
     keyboard_interrupt();
     ~keyboard_interrupt();
    };
    ```
    
10. Virtual Functions
    1. Specially “marked” function of a base class (keyword: virtual)
    2. Derived class may override it, thereby providing a specialized implementation for its instances
    3. help CPP  to achieve polymorphism
    4. A class with a virtual function should also have a virtual destructor
    5. Unlike in java, not every function in CPP derived class is virtual. 
        
        **Q: why:**
        
        - Calling a virtual function add overhead to runtime, because runtime need to figure out whether the function in base or derived class should be called. For flexibility, CPP allow developer to decide whether they want this overhead.

### Interrupts on x86: PIC (略， 已经复制到 week 4的相关位置)

1. Hardware for Interrupt req
    - x86 CPUs up to and including i486 only have only one interrupt line (`INT`) + one `NMI` line
        - `INT` can be masked with IE bit in EFLAGS register using `cli` (disable interrupt handling)and `sti` (enable interrupt handling)
        - `NMI` cannot be masked in the CPU (“non-maskable interrupt”)
    - How to support interrupt from multiple devices?
        - Use External controller and let it puts IRQ number on memory bus, i.e, Use Programmable Interrupt Controller to multiplex the `INT`
2. Workflow of Hardware IRQ with PIC
    1. PIC send interrupt req to CPU
    2. CPU interrupt app and save app state, then send ack to PIC, which means the CPU is ready to handle the IRQ
    3. PIC put IRQ number on CPU Date bus
    4. CPU pick up the IRQ number and send ack to PIC
    5. CPU look at the IDT , find the proper handler, then call this handler
    6. After the Interrupt is handled by the handler,  handler return control to cpu
    7. CPU resume the execution of app again 
3. Interrupt Descriptor Table
    - Has max . 256 entries
    - The base address and size is stored in IDTR
    - Each entry in IDT can be:
        - Task gate (Hardware tasks)
        - Trap gate (Exception handler)
        - Interrupt gate (**Exception handler + cli:**  CPU disable the interrupt automatically while handling a interrupt)
    - Entry 0-31 are for traps (Exception that occurs synchronously to control flow, e.g, Page fault, Breakpoint ..)  (固定的)
    - Entries 32–255 for IRQs (configurable):  we can define
        - Software trap (system call) (INT <number>)
        - Hardware interrupt (CPU’s INT pin would go to HIGH if interrupt is coming, #number is placed on data bus by PIC)
4. State Saving
    1. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU automatically saves a part of its state on the stack
        1. Stack pointer (rsp)
        2. Return address (rip)
        3. For some exceptions (=“traps”): additionally an error code (8 bytes)
        4. Stack frame pointer(rbp)
        5. etc.
    2. Automatically saved state is restored by `iretq` instruction

### Introduction to TASK 1 (留待 复习代码再补充)

1. CGA programming
    
    See slides Exercise 1
    

1. TASK 1 Keyboard
    
    See Exercise 2
    

### Introduction to TASK 2(留待 复习代码再补充)

1. PIC programming: E02 (31-36) 
2. PIC init setup: E03(20-26)
3. Q:  why do we need to pass gate as reference to assign function? E03(29)
    
    ![Untitled](2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled%202.png)
    
    By default argument is passed by copy. If we don’t pass the gate as reference, a copy of a gate would be created when we call assign function. This copy will be destroyed after the assign function executed. This can cause unexpected behavior.
    

### Lab Task #3

![Untitled](2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled%203.png)

1. Pro/Epilogue Model: E03 (32-34)
2.  Tricky Pointers: Queue in Task 3 for storing the pending epilogue in L1 E03 (34-35)
3. Epilogue queue is located in L1, when and how should the access to the queue be synchronized?
    
    ![Untitled](2%20week%209a8e1b06bc5340a68b5943ecf612a4c0/Untitled%204.png)
    
    - When
        - Dequeue happens  (on level 1/2)
            - if a app thread running on L1/2 want to return to level 0 and explicitly calls leave()
            - prologue calls relay() to ask for a epilogue(). Because the lock is free, the epilogue get executed. Now we call leave(). [see](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/guard/guard.cc#L45)
        - Enqueue happens (on level 1)
            - Interrupt is coming and the correspondent prologue is called. the prologue calls relay to ask for a epilogue. However the lock is not free, therefore relay has to enqueue the epilogue to the queue.
        - Enqueue may interrupt dequeue, therefore we have to do synchronization on the queue
    - How?
        - Hard synchronization: Place the queue on L1, before any dequeue operation, we do Hard synchronization
        - Non blocking: Place the queue on L1/2, we have to design a non-blocking algorithm so that the queue doesn’t break if enqueue interrupt dequeue.
4. For the Guard::leave(),  Which condition must hold when leaving this function? How to achieve this condition?
    - The condition:
    
    we must ensure that there is no epilogue in the queue. Otherwise the pending epilogue may not be executed for a very long time.
    
    - How?
        - What’s wrong with the code?
            
            ```cpp
            void Guard::leave(){
                while(true){
            
                    cpu.disable_int(); //Prologue shouldn't be interrupted
                    item = (Gate *)queue.dequeue();       
            	      cpu.disable_int();
                    if(!item){           //empty queue
                        break;
                    }
                    item->queued(false);
                    item->epilogue();
                }
            		<----------------if Interrupt happens here, the epilogue is queued. 
            										Becausewe still in the critical section. The consequece is
            										the pending epilogue won't be executed for a very long time.
                retne ();
            }
            ```
            
        - Fix the problem
        
        ```cpp
        void Guard::leave(){
            while(true){
        
                cpu.disable_int(); //Prologue shouldn't be interrupted
                item = (Gate *)queue.dequeue();       
               
                if(!item){           //empty queue
                    break;
                }
                item->queued(false);
                cpu.enable_int();
                item->epilogue();
            }
            //INTR here is still disabled
            retne ();
            cpu.enable_int();
        }
        ```
        
5. Gate::queued(), what’s this there for?  [see](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/guard/guard.cc#L38)
    
    We have to make sure that one object won’t be queued twice. The reason is the queue is derived from chain class, which only has a next pointer. If we enqueue the object twice, the enqueue will set the next pointer of the object to null and we will lose the objects that are chained after the object. [see](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/object/queue.cc#L27)
    
6. Interactions between prologue and epilogue, do we need to synchronize here as well?
Yes, we do.  One example here is the keyboard prologue and keyboard epilogue. The prologue checks the keyboard registers status and fetch the key, while the epilogue have to do the rest, such as processing the key. Here we have to again a shared data structure so that prologue can it to send the key to epilogue. The easiest way is non blocking synchronization, which place a char variable on level 1/2. The disadvantage is that we may lose keys. [See](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/device/keyboard.h#L28)  

### Task 4

1. Overview: E04 7-8

## Task 1

### Qeustions:

1. 怎末将 各种 type 的number 转换成 char value 并在屏幕上输出？
    - 将各种 类型的数字都先转换成 long value
    - 然后 将 long number 转换为 char array
    - [Detail see](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/object/o_stream.cc#L29)
2.  上一个问题中 的 char array 的 size 应该是多少？
    
    现在默认设置的是  80， 因为 long value 有 8 BYTE, 转化成 二进制数字 需要长度至少为 64 byte的char array [(see)](https://github.com/yaoxin1995/oostubs/blob/main/object/o_stream.cc#L22)
    
    改进， 使用 sizeof  得到 long value的大小 然后乘8 + 额外5-10 BYYE 最为 char array 的大小
